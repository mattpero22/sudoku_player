  - generated board and display function, began working with a hash table approach
  - Used two for loops to iterate through all rows and columns (computes row by row)
  - On empty cells, the row then column is checked to fill hash table of numbers that wont work, results printed in console

  - removed hash table and instead edit a string directly which contains only possible values after checking each row, column, and 3x3 zone
  - having issues with recursive logic for the way I am passing the possible values in on each call, as it can't backtrack to more than one previous
